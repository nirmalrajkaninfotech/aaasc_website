# Next.js Static Export Guide

## What We're Doing
Converting your Next.js app from server-side rendering (SSR) to static export to avoid Vercel deployment issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `next.config.ts`
- Set `output: 'export'` for static generation
- Disabled image optimization (`unoptimized: true`)
- Enabled trailing slashes for better static hosting

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Added `build:static` script
- Updated `static-build` script

## How to Build and Deploy

### Step 1: Build Static Version
```bash
npm run build:static
```

This will create a static build in the `out/` directory.

### Step 2: Test Locally
```bash
# Install a simple static server
npm install -g serve

# Serve the static build
serve out/
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically detect the static export
3. Your site will be built as static HTML/CSS/JS

## What This Means

### ✅ **Advantages:**
- **No server-side errors** - Everything is pre-built
- **Faster loading** - Static files are served directly
- **Better caching** - CDN can cache everything
- **Works everywhere** - Can deploy to any static hosting

### ⚠️ **Limitations:**
- **No dynamic data** - All data must be included at build time
- **No API routes** - Can't use `/api/*` endpoints
- **No server-side features** - No middleware, dynamic routes, etc.

## Current Status

Your app will now:
1. **Build completely static** at build time
2. **Include all data** in the build (using fallback data)
3. **Deploy without errors** to Vercel
4. **Work offline** once loaded

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes
2. **Build locally** to test: `npm run build:static`
3. **Deploy to Vercel** - it will automatically use static export
4. **Your site will work** with all the existing content

## If You Need Dynamic Features Later

You can always:
1. **Revert to SSR** by changing `output: 'standalone'` back
2. **Deploy admin server** to a service like Railway/Render
3. **Use hybrid approach** with some static, some dynamic pages

For now, this gives you a working, deployable website!
