# ✅ Static Site Ready for cPanel!

## 🎉 Success! Your static site is built!

**No server needed** - This is a pure static HTML/CSS/JS site that works on any web hosting.

---

## 📁 What Was Built

✅ **Static HTML files** - All pages are pre-rendered  
✅ **No server required** - Pure static files  
✅ **No API routes** - Excluded for static export  
✅ **Ready for cPanel** - Just upload and go!

---

## 📦 File Structure

Your `out/` folder now contains:
```
out/
├── index.html          ← Homepage (in root!)
├── about/
│   └── index.html
├── contact/
│   └── index.html
├── gallery/
│   └── index.html
├── _next/             ← CSS, JS, images
│   └── static/
├── .htaccess          ← Routing rules
└── ... (all other pages)
```

**✅ This is correct for static hosting!**

## 🚀 Deploy to cPanel (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Create Zip File

```bash
./zip-for-cpanel.sh
```

Or manually:
- Go into `out/` folder
- Select ALL files
- Create zip: `cpanel-static.zip`

### Step 2: Upload to cPanel

1. Login to cPanel
2. Open **File Manager**
3. Go to `public_html/`
4. Upload the zip file
5. Extract it
6. **Important:** Files should be directly in `public_html/`, not in a subfolder

### Step 3: Verify .htaccess

The `.htaccess` file is already included in the zip. Make sure it's in `public_html/` root.

---

## ✅ Verification

After uploading, check:
- [ ] `index.html` is in `public_html/` root
- [ ] `.htaccess` file exists in root
- [ ] `_next/` folder exists
- [ ] All page folders exist (about/, contact/, etc.)
- [ ] File permissions: 644 (files), 755 (folders)

## 🌐 Test Your Site

Visit: `https://yourdomain.com`

Should work immediately - **no server setup needed!**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **This is a STATIC site** - No Node.js, no server, no API routes
2. **API calls won't work** - Use external API server if needed
3. **File structure is different** - Files are in root, not `server/app/`
4. **.htaccess is included** - Already in the zip file

---

✅ Static export enabled  
✅ Build completed successfully  
✅ Files ready in `out/` folder
